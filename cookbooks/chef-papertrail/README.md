chef-papertrail
===============

Chef cookbook for sending syslog and application logs to Papertrail.

You probably want to check out [firstbanco/chef-papertrail](https://github.com/firstbanco/chef-papertrail/) or [librato/papertrail-cookbook](https://github.com/librato/papertrail-cookbook) before using this.  I made it because those had more dependencies and made more assumptions than I wanted, but they're probably better.
